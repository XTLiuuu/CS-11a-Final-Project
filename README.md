# TicTacToe
TicTacToe is a game for two players. One is X and the other is O. Players take turns to fill the spaces in a 3 x 3 grid. The player who place there marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row is the winner. In this program, this is a game between the user and the computer. 

There are two folders in the github. The "TicTacToe" folder plays in the Terminal for Macs or Shell for Windows. The "TicTacToeGUI" has a GUI feature. Players can play games in a pop-up GUI window.
